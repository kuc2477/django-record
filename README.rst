``django-record`` automatically creates an extra record when an audited 
Django model instance has been changed either directly or indirectly.

``RecordModel`` will detect any changes in ``recording_fields`` of
``recording_model`` at it's post save() time or ``auditing_relatives``'s
post save() time and create an new record for it. 

You can access records via record manager ``records`` in your recorded model
instance. You can also access recorded model's instance via ``recording``, 
which is in effect ``ForeignKey``. from your records.

More conveniently, just mixin ``RecordedModelMixin`` to your model and provide 
``recording_fields`` and ``auditing_relatives`` as ``RecordModel`` to record 
specific model.

Mixins
======
``django-record`` provides mixins which auto-registers ``RecordModel`` for your mixed in
model to help your model instance recording.

* *RecordedModelMixin*
    **Attributes**
        - ``recording_fields`` (*list*): A List consists of either to-be-recoreded field
          names or tuples of a property name and it's field instance to
          be saved in database.
    
        - ``auditing_relatives`` (*list*): A List of audited relatives. An extra record
          will be created on every ``save()`` calls of these relative instances that indirectly
          affects the recording instance, along with recording on direct ``save()`` calls from
          ``recording_model`` instances.
    
        - ``RecordMeta`` (*class*): A class storing meta information for recording. Set
          ``audit_all_relatives`` to audit all relatives of your recorded model's instance.
          Note that auditing all relatives can cause a performance issue in large scale
          database.
    
    **Example**
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
        from django.db import models
        from django.db.models import Sum
        
        from django_record.models import TimeStampedModel
        from django_record.mixins import RecordedModelMixin
        
        
        class Article(RecordedModelMixin, TimeStampedModel):
            author = models.ForeignKey(User, related_name='articles')
            title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
            
            @property
            def total_comment_count(self):
                return self.comments.count()
            
            @property

                int(self.votes.aggregate(Sum('score'))['score__sum'])

Models
======
``django-record`` provides models for recording model instances, including RecordModel and
TimeStampedModel.

* *RecordModel*
    **Attributes**
        - ``recording_model`` (*class*): A model class to be recorded. An extra record
          will be created on every changed ``save()`` calls of it's instance or
          audited relative's ``save()`` calls.
    
        - ``recording_fields`` (*list*): A List consists of either to-be-recoreded field
          names or tuples of a property name and it's field instance to
          be saved in database.
    
        - ``auditing_relatives`` (*list*): A List of audited relatives. An extra record
          will be created on every ``save()`` calls of these relative instances that indirectly
          affects the recording instance, along with recording on direct ``save()`` calls from
          ``recording_model`` instances.
    
        - ``RecordMeta`` (*class*): A class storing meta information for recording. Set
          ``audit_all_relatives`` to audit all relatives of your recorded model's instance.
          Note that auditing all relatives can cause a performance issue in large scale
          database.

    ...
    
    >>> count_before = a.total_comment_count
    >>>
    >>> Comment.objects.create(article=a, text='text of comment')   # recorder creates first record for created comment and
    >>>                                                             # a new record for existing article, updating 'total_comment_count'.
    >>> r = a.records.latest()
    >>> r.total_comment_count == count_before + 1
    >>> True
    
    ...
    
    >>> records_before_yesterday = d.records.filter(created__lte=yesterday)     # you can filter records by created time.
    >>> records_of_today = d.records.filter(created__gte=today)
    
    ...


Note
====
* **Only primitive types are supported for properties** and **you must
  offer appropriate field** for them when you put a tuple of a property
  name and it's field in 'recording_fields' for expected recording.

* ``RecordModel`` is also a subclass of ``TimeStampedModel``, so **make sure that
  you don't record either 'created' or 'modified' fields.**
