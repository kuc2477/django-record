*************
``django-record`` automatically creates an extra record when an audited 
Django model instance has been changed.

``RecordModel`` will detect any changes of ``recording_fields`` in
``recording_model`` at it's *post_save* time and create an record for it.  

You can access records via record manager ``records`` in your recorded model
instance. Also, you are able to access audited model instance via ``recording`` in
your records, which is in effect ``ForeignKey``.

Attributes
==========
    * ``recording_model`` (*class*): A model class to be recorded. An extra record
      will be created on every changed ``save()`` calls of it's instance or
      auditing relative's ``save()`` calls.
    * ``recording_fields`` (*list*): A List consists of either to-be-recoreded field
      names or tuples of a property name and it's field instance to
      be saved in database.
    * ``auditing_relatives`` (*list*): A List of audited relatives. An extra record
      will be created on every ``save()`` calls of relative instances that
      affects recording instance, along with recording on recording-
      instance-changing ``save()`` calls.

Example
=======
.. code-block:: python

    from django.db import models
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    from django_record.models import TimeStampedModel
    from django_record.models import RecordModel
    
    class Debate(models.Model):
        user = models.ForeignKey(User)
    
        title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        num_of_pros = models.IntegerField()
        num_of_cons = models.IntegerField()
    
        @property
        def pros_rate(self):
            return self.num_of_pros // (self.num_of_pros + self.num_of_cons)
    
        @property
        def cons_rate(self):
            return self.num_of_cons // (self.num_of_pros + self.num_of_cons)
    
        @property
        def user_name(self):
            return user.username
    
    class DebateRecord(RecordModel):
        recording_model = Debate
        recording_fields = [
            'title', 'num_of_pros', 'num_of_cons'
            ('pros_rate', models.FloatField()),
            ('cons_rate', models.FloatField()),
            ('user_name', models.CharField(max_length=100))
        ]
    
        auditing_relatives = ['user', ]
    
    >>> d =  Debate.objects.first()
    >>> r =  d.records.latest()
    >>> assert(d.title == r.title)
    >>> assert(d.pros_rate == r.pros_rate)
    ...
    >>> records_before_yesterday = d.records.filter(created__lte=yesterday)
    >>> records_of_today = d.records.filter(created__gte=today)
    ...
    >>> u = d.user
    >>> u.username = 'changed user name'
    >>> u.save()
    >>> r = d.records.latest()
    >>> assert(d.user_name == r.user_name)
    >> assert(d.user.username == r.user_name)

Note
====
* **Only primitive types are supported for properties** and you must
  offer appropriate field for them when you put a tuple of a property
  name and it's field in 'recording_fields' for expected recording.
* RecordModel is also a subclass of TimeStampedModel, so **make sure that
  you don't record either 'created' or 'modified' fields.**
